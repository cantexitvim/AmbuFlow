## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting


## Mentorship & Learning Environment

We encourage mentors to provide guidance and support to help contributors grow in coding and open-source collaboration. Mentorship is key to fostering learning and improvement.

## Respect for Open Source Contribution

We value contributions of all sizes and skill levels, promoting respect for everyone’s effort. Every contribution is meaningful and helps the project grow.

## Collaboration over Competition

Teamwork and knowledge sharing are prioritized over competition, with the goal of achieving common project objectives. We strive to work together to make progress.

## Contribution Etiquette

When contributing, follow best practices such as writing clear commits, adhering to coding standards, and making thoughtful pull requests. This ensures quality and consistency in our work.

## Diversity in Technical Backgrounds

We encourage contributions from individuals with diverse technical skills, as different perspectives and expertise enrich the project. Varied skill sets are a strength of open source.

## Time Zones and Availability

As a global community, we recognize that participants may be in different time zones. Patience and flexibility in communication are crucial to ensure smooth collaboration.

## Project Vision & Shared Goals

Contributors are encouraged to align their efforts with the project’s long-term objectives and sustainability. Understanding the project vision helps create meaningful and impactful contributions.


## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders (Project Admins and Mentors) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. Reasons for moderation decisions will be communicated when appropriate.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces related to this project and also applies when an individual is representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing the community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as a representative at an online or offline event.


## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the **Mentor/Project Admin** responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT EMAIL].

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.


### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.
